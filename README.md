## Building a Resilient Digital Future: Proposing Legal Reforms for Cyber Law in Bangladesh Based on Leading Global Examples

## Introduction
As our world becomes more digital, it’s important for countries to make sure people are safe and secure online. In Bangladesh, more people and businesses are using the internet for things like communication, shopping, and public services. But as we use more technology, problems like hacking, online scams, and data theft are also increasing.
Bangladesh has made some progress with laws like the Digital Security Act, but these laws still have some gaps and need to be improved to better protect people online. To build a safer and stronger digital future, it’s important to update our cyber laws and learn from other countries that are doing well.
This report looks at Bangladesh’s current cyber laws and studies the digital safety systems of the world’s five happiest countries—Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, and the Netherlands. These countries are not only happy but also have strong online safety rules. By learning from them, Bangladesh can improve its digital security and help create a safer and happier country for everyone.
