In an increasingly digital world, ensuring online safety, data privacy, and cybersecurity is essential to a nationâ€™s overall development and public well-being. Bangladesh is experiencing rapid digital growth, with rising internet usage across communication, business, education, and public services. However, this digital expansion also brings challenges such as cybercrime, data breaches, and online misinformation.

Although the government has taken steps through laws like the <strong>Digital Security Act 2018</strong>, existing legislation remains limited in scope and effectiveness. Significant gaps remain in areas like personal data protection, digital rights, and the regulation of emerging technologies. To address these challenges, a more comprehensive, rights-based, and forward-looking legal framework is needed.

This report examines the current cyber law landscape in Bangladesh and analyzes the digital governance models of the worldâ€™s five happiest countriesâ€”<strong>Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden,</strong> and <strong>the Netherlands</strong>. These countries not only top global happiness rankings but also demonstrate strong cybersecurity infrastructure, data protection measures, and public trust in digital systems. By adopting and adapting two key practices from these nations, Bangladesh can work toward building a safer, more inclusive, and digitally secure societyâ€”one that contributes to national well-being and long-term happiness.
